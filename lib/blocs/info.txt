BLoC design pattern: 
BLoC is a state management library that lets us separate UI from the business logic. The UI will send events 
to the BLoC which will trigger state changes and as the state changes, the BLoC will communicate with the data 
repository. Once it gets a response, it will emit a new state that in turn will update the UI.
